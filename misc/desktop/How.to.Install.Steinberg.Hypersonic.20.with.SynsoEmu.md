## Step 1: Download the Rebuild SynsoEmu Package
 
The first step is to download the Rebuild SynsoEmu package from a reliable source. This package contains the updated installer and the SynsoEmu.dll file that will replace the original driver-based emulator. You can find this package on various torrent sites, such as RuTracker.org[^1^], or on some blogs, such as monsetahaptihitch.wixsite.com[^2^]. The file size is about 1.58 GB and the file name is Steinberg - Hypersonic 2.0 (Rebuild SynsoEmu) - AiR.rar.
 
## Step 2: Extract and Run the Installer
 
The next step is to extract the rar file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a folder named Steinberg - Hypersonic 2.0 (Rebuild SynsoEmu) - AiR that contains two files: Setup.exe and SynsoEmu.dll. Run the Setup.exe file and follow the instructions on the screen. You can choose any installation path and any VST folder you want, but make sure you have enough disk space for the content files (about 1.7 GB).
 
## Step 3: Copy and Paste the SynsoEmu.dll File
 
The final step is to copy and paste the SynsoEmu.dll file into the folder where you installed Hypersonic 2.0. This will overwrite the original dll file that came with the installer. This is necessary to make Hypersonic 2.0 work without a dongle and with other products that use the new SynsoEmu technology, such as Groove Agent 2 or The Grand 2.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy Hypersonic 2.0
 
That's it! You have successfully installed Steinberg Hypersonic 2.0 with SynsoEmu on your system. You can now launch it as a standalone application or as a VSTi plugin in your favorite host application.

## What is SynsoEmu and Why Do You Need It?
 
SynsoEmu is a technology developed by AiR, a group of hackers and crackers who specialize in breaking the copy protection of music software. SynsoEmu stands for Synchrosoft Emulator, which is a reference to the company that created the dongle protection for Steinberg products. A dongle is a hardware device that plugs into a USB port and acts as a license key for the software. Without the dongle, the software will not run or will run in demo mode.
 
SynsoEmu is a software solution that emulates the dongle and tricks the software into thinking that it is authorized. This way, you can use the software without having to buy or use the dongle. SynsoEmu also allows you to use multiple products that share the same dongle on the same system, which was not possible before. For example, you can use Hypersonic 2.0 and Groove Agent 2 at the same time without any conflicts.
 
SynsoEmu is not a crack or a patch, but a dll file that replaces the original one in the installation folder. This means that you still need to install the software using the original installer and then copy and paste the SynsoEmu.dll file over it. SynsoEmu does not modify or damage any other files or registry entries on your system.
 
## What are the Benefits and Risks of Using SynsoEmu?
 
Using SynsoEmu has some benefits and some risks that you should be aware of before deciding to use it. Here are some of them:
 
- **Benefits:**
- You can use Steinberg products without buying or using a dongle.
- You can use multiple products that share the same dongle on the same system.
