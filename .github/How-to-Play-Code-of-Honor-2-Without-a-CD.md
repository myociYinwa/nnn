If you own the game and want to play it without inserting the CD every time, you might be looking for a no cd patch or crack. A no cd patch is a modified version of the game's executable file that bypasses the CD check. A no cd crack is a program that simulates the presence of a CD in your drive.
 
However, using a no cd patch or crack can be risky, as they might contain viruses, malware, or unwanted software. They might also violate the game's terms of service and cause compatibility issues with updates or online features.
 
Fortunately, there is a safer and legal way to play Code of Honor 2 without a CD. You can use a virtual drive software that creates a virtual CD image from your original disc and mounts it on your computer. This way, you can play the game as if you had the CD inserted, without any risk of damaging your disc or your computer.
 
Here are the steps to play Code of Honor 2 without a CD using a virtual drive software:
 
1. Download and install a virtual drive software such as Daemon Tools Lite, PowerISO, or Virtual CloneDrive. These are free and reliable programs that can create and mount virtual CD images.
2. Insert your Code of Honor 2 CD into your CD drive and run the virtual drive software. Select the option to create an image from your disc and choose a destination folder to save it. The image file will have an extension such as .iso, .bin, or .cue.
3. Eject your Code of Honor 2 CD from your drive and keep it in a safe place. You won't need it anymore to play the game.
4. Run the virtual drive software again and select the option to mount an image. Browse to the folder where you saved the image file and select it. The virtual drive software will create a virtual CD drive on your computer and assign it a letter such as D: or E:.
5. Run the game from the virtual CD drive or from a shortcut on your desktop. The game will think that you have the CD inserted and will run normally.

Congratulations! You have successfully played Code of Honor 2 without a CD using a virtual drive software. Enjoy the game and remember to always backup your original discs.
  
## Why You Should Play Code of Honor 2 Despite Its Flaws
 
Code of Honor 2: Conspiracy Island is not a perfect game by any means. It has been criticized for its outdated graphics, poor gameplay, and lackluster story by many reviewers[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].

The game has a decent length of about 3 hours[^2^], which is enough to keep you entertained without overstaying its welcome.

You can play online or offline with up to 16 players in various modes, such as deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag, and sabotage. You can choose from different maps and settings, such as jungle, desert, urban, and night. You can also customize your character and weapons with different skins and attachments.
